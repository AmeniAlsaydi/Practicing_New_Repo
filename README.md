## Practicing making Github repos through terminal:

### STEPS TO CREATE NEW REPO ON TERMINAL 
1. mkdir directoryname: creates directory locally 
    then cd into the directory 
1. touch README.md (creates a README.md but it can be any file.)
1. git init (initializes an existing directory as a Git repo)
    Ex) output: Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/amyalsaydi/Documents/Creating_Github_repo2/.git/
1. git add README.md (or any file) 
    note* prior to this status the file should be red and after the file should be green
1. git commit -m â€œenter detailed description of change made to code).
1. Make new repo on GitHub.com and copy git origin line
    git remote add origin repo_url
1. Set remote as upstream 
    git push --set-upstream origin master
